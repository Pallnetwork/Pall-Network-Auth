Hello Replit AI 👋

My app is “Pall Network” (Web + PWA + Android + iOS).  
Everything is already working fine (Firebase Auth, Mining, Wallet, Policies, Dashboard).  
Now I need you to prepare the *final deployable builds setup* for both *Android (Gradle) + iOS (Expo EAS / Xcode)* and deliver them as a single ZIP file.

---

✅ Requirements:

1. *Android Build (Gradle)*
   - Include android/ folder with full Gradle project structure.
   - Include android/build.gradle, app/build.gradle, and proper package name.
   - Integrate google-services.json (I will upload mine).
   - Ensure "Sync Project with Gradle Files" works inside Android Studio.
   - Make sure I can build .apk and .aab without errors.
   - App icon, splash screen, and PWA logo must display correctly.

2. *iOS Build (Expo EAS / Xcode)*
   - Include ios/ folder with Xcode project files.
   - Add app.json or app.config.js with correct iOS bundle identifier.
   - Integrate Firebase for iOS using GoogleService-Info.plist (I will upload mine).
   - Ensure app builds in Xcode simulator and Expo EAS (eas build -p ios).
   - iOS app should have working icons, splash screen, and policies pages.

3. *Mining & Wallet*
   - Mining rate fixed to exactly *1 Pall Token per 24 hours* (already updated).
   - Balance updates stored in Firestore wallet → pallBalance field.
   - Wallet integration with MetaMask / Trust Wallet must work on production domain.

4. *Homepage + Policies*
   - Root path / should show new professional Homepage (with navigation, hero, about).
   - Sidebar/footer links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Disclaimer.
   - All policies must be included for Play Store + App Store compliance.

5. *PWA Compatibility*
   - manifest.json and service worker included.
   - App installable on Chrome/Edge/Safari.
   - Icons properly included for web + PWA + mobile builds.

⚡ Deliverables:

- Provide me with a *single ZIP file* containing:
  - Full source code
  - android/ folder (Gradle project)
  - ios/ folder (Xcode / Expo project)
  - Config files (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist placeholders)
  - Assets (logos, splash, icons)

So that I can:
- Open in *Android Studio* → Sync Gradle → Build .apk and .aab.
- Open in *Xcode* or run eas build -p ios → Get iOS .ipa for App Store.
- Deploy web + PWA build as before.

🔎 Debug Checklist:

✅ Android project builds without Gradle errors in Android Studio  
✅ iOS project builds without Xcode/EAS errors  
✅ Logo + icons appear correctly in browser tab, PWA, Android & iOS  
✅ Mining logic = 1 Pall Token per 24h  
✅ Firebase Auth + Wallet working  
✅ Homepage + Policies live

Please prepare this *final ZIP export* with Android + iOS build setup ready for app store submission.
