Hello Replit AI 👋

Please fix and finalize the *Mining System* in my “Pall Network” app.  
Currently, the *Start Mining ⛏ button is not showing* and the mining logic is not fully correct.  

✅ Requirements:

1. Mining Button Visibility
- Ensure the Start Mining ⛏ button is always visible when a logged-in user opens /app/dashboard.
- Button text states:
   - “Start Mining ⛏” when mining is not running.
   - “Mining in Progress ⛏ (hh:mm:ss remaining)” while mining is active.
- After 24 hours, the button must reset back to “Start Mining ⛏”.

2. Mining Logic
- Mining must only start when the user presses the Start Mining button.
- Mining runs for *exactly 24 hours (86,400 seconds)*.
- Rate = *1 PALL token per 24 hours* (0.00001157 PALL/second).
- Balance should increment in real-time and be saved in Firestore (wallets/{userId}/pallBalance).
- After 24 hours:
   - Mining auto-stops.
   - Button resets back to Start Mining.
   - Mining must NOT auto-restart unless the user presses the button again.

3. Persistence & Compliance
- Store mining state in Firestore (start time, remaining time, current balance) so that the mining progress continues if the user refreshes or logs in from another device.
- Must follow Google Play Store policy:
   - Mining should never auto-start without user clicking.
   - User must always have control to start each cycle manually.
   - Exactly 1 PALL token is earned every 24 hours, no more.

🛠 Deliverables:
- Update MiningDashboard.tsx (or equivalent component).
- Make the Start Mining ⛏ button visible and functional.
- Fix mining rate to *0.00001157 PALL/second*.
- Ensure 24-hour mining cycle stops and resets correctly.
- Verify Firestore balance updates in real time and persists.

🚀 Expected Flow:
1. User logs in → sees *Start Mining ⛏* button.
2. User clicks → mining starts (0.00001157/sec).
3. After 24 hours → mining auto-stops, button resets.
4. User must click again to start a new cycle.
5. Balance updates correctly in Firestore and shows in the UI.

Thank you 🙏
