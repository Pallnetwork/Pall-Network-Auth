Hello Replit AI 👋

My app name is “Pall Network”.  
Everything is working fine (Firebase Auth, Wallet, Policies, PWA setup, APK build), but I need one important fix for the mining button UI and logic.

✅ Task: Mining Button Update

1. Move the ⛏ Mining button from the sidebar → main dashboard screen.  
   - When user logs in and opens dashboard, the mining section should be visible directly (no need to click sidebar).  
   - Dashboard should show:
     - Current Balance (from Firestore wallet → “pallBalance” field)
     - Mining Button (⛏ Start Mining or Stop Mining)
     - Mining Status (Active / Inactive)
     - Countdown timer (hh:mm:ss) until next mining is available

2. Mining Rules:
   - A user can start mining once every 24 hours.
   - When mining is started:
     - Mining stays active for 24h continuously.
     - Pall tokens keep accumulating and are saved in Firestore wallet balance (real-time or at interval).
     - Mining button should be disabled during active period.
   - After 24h completes → show “Start Mining” button again.

3. Wallet Balance:
   - In sidebar “Wallet” section → show the same “pallBalance” from Firestore.
   - Balance should increase automatically while mining is active.

🛠 Deliverables from Replit AI

- Update Dashboard UI to show the mining module (with button + timer + balance).
- Remove mining button from sidebar (only dashboard should control mining).
- Ensure mining session logic is stored in Firestore:
  - Save miningStartTime for each user.
  - Calculate next available mining start time = miningStartTime + 24h.
- Update balance increment correctly in Firestore wallet document (wallets/{userId}/pallBalance).
- Keep referral and reward system unchanged.
