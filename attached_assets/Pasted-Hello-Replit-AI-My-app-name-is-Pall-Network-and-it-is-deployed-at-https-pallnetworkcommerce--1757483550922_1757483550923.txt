Hello Replit AI 👋

My app name is “Pall Network” and it is deployed at https://pallnetworkcommerce.com.  
I need you to finalize the app and prepare production-ready deliverables. Please complete the following tasks:

---

✅ 1. Logo & Favicon Fix
- Fix missing app logo and favicon after deployment.
- Ensure correct favicon.ico, logo192.png, logo512.png in /public folder.
- Update manifest.json with correct icon paths.
- Confirm logo appears in browser tab, PWA install, Android/iOS builds.

---

✅ 2. Mining Speed Update
- Adjust mining logic so users mine exactly *1 Pall token per 24 hours*.
- When mining is active:
  - Tokens accumulate continuously over 24 hours.
  - Save balance in Firestore (wallets/{userId}/pallBalance).
  - Countdown timer must show time remaining until next mining cycle.
- After 24h, reset button to “Start Mining”.
