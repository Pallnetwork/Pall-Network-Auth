Hello Replit AI 👋

My app name is “Pall Network” and it is already deployed as Web + PWA + Firebase Auth + Wallet integration.  
Now I need the final Android/iOS build setup.

✅ Task: Generate Android Studio–Ready Project ZIP

1. Create a complete Android Studio–compatible project structure:
   - android/build.gradle
   - app/build.gradle
   - settings.gradle
   - gradle-wrapper.properties
   - AndroidManifest.xml
   - MainActivity.java / MainActivity.kt
   - Package name: com.pallnetwork
   - App name: PALL NETWORK
   - App icon: use elephant icon (replace default launcher icon)

2. Firebase Integration:
   - Include Firebase Auth + Firestore (already working in my app)
   - Add google-services plugin in build.gradle
   - Prepare placeholder for google-services.json
   - I will upload my actual google-services.json to Replit for you to include in app module

3. Web + PWA integration:
   - Bundle my existing PWA into Android wrapper (WebView or Trusted Web Activity)
   - Make sure mining dashboard, wallet connect, Firebase auth, and policies pages work inside Android app

4. iOS Support:
   - Prepare project files compatible with Expo EAS or Xcode build (Info.plist, iOS configs)
   - Make sure icons and splash screen are included for iOS as well

5. Deliverables:
   - Provide me with a downloadable *ZIP file* of the Android Studio project
   - The project should open in Android Studio without errors
   - “Sync Project with Gradle Files” should work correctly
   - Build menu should allow me to generate APK and AAB for Google Play Store
   - iOS folder should be compatible with Expo/Xcode builds

📌 Debug Checklist
- android/build.gradle and app/build.gradle correctly configured
- google-services.json integrated under app/ folder
- Firebase Auth + Firestore initialized
- App icon (elephant) used for launcher
- APK/AAB build possible from Android Studio without errors
- Web app features (mining, wallet, auth, policies) run smoothly inside native app

⚡ Please create this Android Studio + iOS project ZIP file and give me the download link.
I will upload my google-services.json so you can include it in the final ZIP.
